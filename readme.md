# Python answers Javascript requests with native libraries

* Data bypassing same-origin policy with [JSONP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP)
* support both py2 and py3 with only build-in libraries (just for demo, never use them for real projects)
* javascript demo uses [jquery](https://jquery.com/) to make http requests and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) to display the result. /// I know it's a weird combination but my friend asked me to use them ╮(╯_╰)╭ 

# Usage
1. Run the server script: `python server.py`
2. Open index.html with any browsers.
